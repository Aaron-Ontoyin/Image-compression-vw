## A little story behind the project
This project held a unique significance for me, rooted in my personal experiences. The catalyst for my project choice was a simple yet impactful observation: a large image on my profile site caused slow loading times, significantly affecting user experience. This experience, coupled with a recent visit to 'Silicon Valley' and the resonating words of Gavin Belson - "Data creation is exploding, with all the selfies and useless files people refuse to delete on the cloud" - underscored the critical importance of data optimization in our digital age. This realization motivated me to embark on the Image Compression Algorithm project, with a focus on enhancing data management and user experiences.
